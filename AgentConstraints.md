Agent constraints:

-Do not create any new md or txt files unless specifically requested to do so.
-Document all our conversation into AI_Interaction.md so that it can be used to set context for what was done before.
-Do not use emojis in the documentaiton or code comments, use ascii art if required or just DONE or NOT DONE for tasks.
-Add detailed comments to all the code you write so that I can understand it when I read the code
